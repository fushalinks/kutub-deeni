    <div class="chapter">
      <p> When Muhammad, the Prophet of Allah (SAS) became forty years old,
        Allah sent him as a mercy to the worlds and bearer of good tidings to
        mankind. Allah had made a covenant with every Prophet. whom He had sent
        before him that he should believe in Him, verify Him and vindicate Him
        against whoever disagreed with Him. He required of them that they should
        convey this to everyone who in them, and they all carried out their
        obligations, in this regard. </p>
      <p> According to 'Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), "When Allah
        wanted to honor Muhammad (SAS) and have mercy on His servants through
        him, the first sign of prophethood to the Prophet (SAS) was true
        visions. Whenever he saw a vision while sleeping it turned to be
        strikingly true, like the brightness of daybreak. And Allah made him
        love solitude so that he liked nothing more than to be alone. </p>
      <p> Abdul-Malik ibn Obaidullah reported that the Prophet (SAS) at the time
        when Allah wanted to bestow His grace upon him and begin (the state of)
        prophethood, would head out for his purpose and go far as the mountain
        passes of Makkah and the beds of its valleys where no house was seen.
        There was not a stone nor a tree that he passed by. but would say, peace
        be upon you. “O Messenger of Allah". The Prophet (SAS) would turn to his
        right. and behind him and would find no more than trees and stones.
        Thus, he kept on seeing and hearing such things so long as Allah willed,
        Then Jibril (peace be upon him) came to him with Allah's grace while he
        was in the month of Ramadan. </p>
      <p> According to 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr, the Prophet of Allah (SAS) used to
        stay in privacy in Hira every year for a month to practice tahannuth
        (worship and devotion away from idols) a religious custom known in
        Quraysh in the pre-Islamic period. Every year during that month the
        Prophet (SAS) would worship in privacy and give food to the poor who
        came to him. At the end of the month. the first thing he used to do
        before returning home was to go to the Ka'bah and circumambulate seven
        times or as often Allah wished, then he would return to his house. In
        the month Of Ramadan in which Allah willed to honor him with the
        Mission, the Prophet (SAS) went to Hira as was usual to him, and his
        family was with him. When it was night on which Allah honored him with
        His Message; Jibril came to him with the command of Allah. The Prophet
        (SAS) said: </p>
      <p> "<i>Jibril came to me while I was asleep with a coverlet of brocade
          whereon was something written and said, ‘Read!’ I said. ‘I do not
          read’. He took me and squeezed me so vehemently that thought it was
          death; then he let me go and said. ‘Read’ I said, ‘l do not read’ He
          took me and squeezed so vehemently that thought it was death, then he
          let me go and said, ‘Read!’ I said. What shall I read?' He took me and
          squeezed me so vehemently that thought it was death; then he said.
          'Read' I said; 'What (then) shall I read?' He said</i>, </p>
      <p> </p>
      <div class="ayaat-wrapper"> <span class="ayah-text"> ﴾ Read in the name
          of your Lord who created. Has created man from a clot Read! And your
          Lord is the Most Generous, Who taught by the pen, Taught man that
          which he knew not. ﴿ </span> <span class="ayah-reference"> (Al-Alaq:
          1-5) </span> </div>
      <p></p>
      <p> <i>So, I read, and he left me. When I got up from my sleep, it was as
          if these words were firmly written in my heart. When I went out on the
          mountain, I heard a voice the sky saying, 'O Muhammad! You are the
          Messenger of Allah and I am Jibril. I raised my head up to the sky to
          see (who was speaking) and it Jibril in the form of a man with feet
          astride saying, “O Muhammad! You are the Messenger of Allah and am
          Jibril”. I stood still, staring at him, neither moving forward or
          backward then made my face turn away him, but whichever direction of
          the sky looked. found him the same. And I remained still neither
          progressing nor regressing until Khadijah sent her messengers
          searching for me as they reached the highest point of Makkah and
          returned to her while I still in the place; Then he left me. I
          returned to my family, I came to Khadijah and sat by her thigh close
          to her. She asked, ‘O Abul-Qassim, where have you been? By Allah, I
          sent my messengers to look for you, as they reached Makkah and turned
          to me.’ Then I apprised her of what had seen, and she said. ‘Rejoice.
          O Cousin and be firm! Surely, by Him in Whose Hand is Khadijah’s soul,
          I hopefully think that you will be the Prophet Of this nation</i>’. </p>
      <p> Then she put on (suitable) clothes and went out to her (paternal)
        cousin, Waraqah ibn Nawfal who had become a christian, and who read
        books and listened from those who followed the Torah and the Gospel. She
        informed him about what the Prophet (SAS) had told her of what he had
        seen and heard. Waraqah cried. "Holy! Holy! Surely. by Him in Whose Hand
        is Waraqah's soul, if you are telling me the truth. O Khadijah, there
        has come to him the greatest Namüs (i.e. Jibril) who came to Musa
        before, and he is the Prophet of this nation. Tell him to be firm." </p>
      <p> Khadijah returned to the Prophet (SAS) and told him what Waraqah had
        said. When the Prophet (SAS) had completed the period of seclusion, and
        returned (to Mecca), in the ﬁrst place he performed the circumambulation
        of the Ka'ba, as was his habit. While he was there, Waraqah met him and
        said. "O Son of my brother, tell me what you have seen and heard." After
        telling him. he said to the Prophet (SAS). "Surely, by Him in Whose Hand
        is Waraqah's soul. you are the Prophet of this nation. There has come to
        the greatest Namüs, who came to Musa. Surely, you will be called a liar,
        you will be hurt. driven out and fought! If I were alive that day, I
        would support (the religion of) Allah to a victory such that He knows"
        Then he leaned near him and kissed his forehead; then the Prophet (SAS)
        returned home. </p>
