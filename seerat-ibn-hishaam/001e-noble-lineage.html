    <h3>The Noble Lineage</h3>
    <h5>from Muhammad (sas) till Adam (as)</h5>
    <div class="chapter">
      <p>Abu Muhammad 'Abdu’l-Malik ibn Hisham said: </p>
      <p>This is the book of the biography of the Messenger of Allah (sas) Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah, ibn 'Abdul-Muttalib
        (whose name was Shayba), ibn Hashim (whose name was Amr), ibn 'Abdu Manaf (whose name was al-Mughlra), ibn
        Qusayy (whose name was Zayd), ibn Kilab, ibn Murra, ibn Ka'b, ibn Lu’ayy, ibn Ghalib, ibn Fihr, ibn Malik, ibn
        al-Nadr, ibn Kinana, ibn Khuzayma, ibn Mudrika (whose name was 'Amir), ibn Ilyas, ibn Mudar, ibn Nizar, ibn
        Ma'add, ibn 'Adnan, ibn Udd (or Udad), ibn Muqawwam, ibn Nahur, ibn Tayrah, ibn Ya'rub, ibn Yashjub, ibn Nabit,
        ibn (Prophet) Isma'il, ibn Ibrahim, [ the intimate friend of the Compassionate Allah] , ibn Tarih (who is Azar),
        ibn Nahur, ibn Sarugh, ibn Ra'u, ibn Falikh, h. ' Aybar r ibn Shalikh, ibn Arfakhshadh, ibn Sam, ibn (Prophet)
        Nuh, ibn Lamk, ibn Mattushalakh, ibn Akhnukh, [ who is the prophet Idris ], ibn Yard, ibn Mahlil, ibn Qaynan,
        ibn Yanish, ibn Shith, ibn Adam (as)</p>
      <p>Ibn Hisham said: I will, with the help of Allah Almighty start this book with Ismail the son of Ibrahim, the
        ancestor of the Messenger of Allah (as), all the descendants down to the Prophet(sas) mentioning what was known
        about them and leaving aside the other sons of Ismail for summarization. Thus I will deal with what is relevant
        to the biography of the Messenger of Allah (sas). I will also refrain from citing some of what Ibn Ishaq had
        examined in this book which did not mention the Prophet (sas), or any irrelevant Quranic verses, nor include
        anything which is a reason, interpretation, or witness serving this book. Besides, I will omit the poems which
        we unknown to those specialized in poems and some thing which wer not admitted by Al-Bakka'ee to be narrated.
        Otherwise I will write everything with the guidance of Allah Almighty so as to narrate after him (Ibn Ishaq) and
        to make it known.</p>
