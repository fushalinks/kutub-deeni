    <p>Ibn Ishaq said:</p>
    <p>Among the things which have reached me about what Isa the Son of Mary stated in the Gospel for his followers
      describing the Messenger of Allah (SAS), is the following. It is extracted from what Yuhannas the Apostle set down
      for them when he wrote the Gospel for them from the Testament of Jesus Son of Mary:</p>
    <p>"He who hates me hates the Lord. Except for that I had done in their presence works which none other before me
      did, they would not have a sin. But from now they are puffed up with pride and think that they will overcome me
      and also the Lord. But the word in the revelation must be fulÔ¨Ålled. They hated me falsely (i.e. without reason).
      But when the Manhamanna who Allah will send to you and who is a sacred spirit from the Lord comes, he will be a
      witness of me and you also, because you were with me in the past. I have spoken unto you about this that you
      should not be in doubt."</p>
    <p>Manhamanna (God bless and preserve him!) in Syriac means Muhammad; in Greek he is the Paraclete.</p>
