  <h3>His marriage to Khadijah (ra)</h3>
  <h5></h5>
  <div class="chapter">
    <p>
      Khadlja was a merchant woman of dignity and wealth. She used to hire men to carry merchandise outside the country
      on a profit-sharing basis, as Quraysh were a people of commerce. When she heard about the prophet’s truthfulness,
      trustworthiness, and honourable character, she sent for him and proposed that he should take her goods to Syria
      and trade with them, while she would pay him more than she paid others. He was to take a lad of hers called
      Maysara. The prophet of Allah accepted the proposal, and the two set forth until they came to Syria.
    </p>

    <p>The prophet (SAS) stopped in the shade of a tree near a monk’s cell, when the monk came up to Maysara and asked
      who the man was who was resting beneath the tree. He told him that he was of Quraysh, from the people the Haram;
      and the monk exclaimed: ‘None but a prophet ever sat beneath this tree!’
    </p>

    <p>Then the prophet (SAS) sold the goods he had brought and bought what he wanted to buy and began the return
      journey to Mecca. At the height of noon when the heat was intense as he rode his beast Maysara saw two angels
      shading the prophet from the sun’s rays. When he brought Khadija her property she sold it and it amounted to
      double its value or thereabouts.
    </p>

    <p>Maysara told her about the two angels who shaded him and of the monk’s words. Khadija was a determined, noble,
      and intelligent woman possessing the properties with which Allah willed to honour her. So when Maysara told her
      these things she sent to the prophet of Allah and said: ‘O son of my uncle I like you because of our relationship
      and your high reputation among your people, your trustworthiness and good character and truthfulness.’ Then she
      proposed marriage. Khadija at that time was the best born woman in Quraysh, of the greatest dignity and, too, the
      richest. All her people were eager to get possession of her wealth if it were possible.
    </p>

    <p>The prophet (SAS) told his uncle's about Khadija's proposal and his uncle Hamza went with him to Khuwaylid ibn
      Asad for proposal and her married her.
    </p>

    <p>She was the mother of all the Prophet's children except Ibrahim. The children are Al-Qasim which was part of his
      surname by which the prophet was called. Abdullah, Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah, peace be upon them
      all.
    </p>

    <p>Al-Qasim and Abdullah died in the pre-Islamic time, while the prophet’s daughters all embraced Islam and migrated
      with him to Madinah.
