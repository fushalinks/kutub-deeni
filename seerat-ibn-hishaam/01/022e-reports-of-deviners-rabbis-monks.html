  <div class="chapter">
    <p>Jewish rabbis, Christian monks, and Arab soothsayers had spoken about the prophet of Allah (SAS) before his
      mission when his time drew near. As to the rabbis and monks,knew about his description and the description of his
      time which they found in their scriptures and what their prophets had enjoined upon them. </p>
    <p>As to the Arab soothsayers they had been visited by satans from the jinn with reports which they had secretly
      overheard before they were prevented from hearing by being pelted with stars. Male and female soothsayers
      continued to mention of some of these matters to which the Arabs paid no attention until Allah sent him and these
      things which had been mentioned happened and they recognized them.</p>
    <p>When the prophetâ€™s mission came the satans were prevented from listening and they could not occupy the seats in
      which they used to sit and steal the heavenly tidings for they were pelted with stars, and the jinn knew that that
      was due to an order which Allah had commanded concerning mankind. </p>
