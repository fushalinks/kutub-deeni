  <div class="chapter">
    <p>The prophet (SAS) lived with his mother Amina bint Wahb and his grandfather Abdul-Muttalib in Allah’s care and
      guardianship growing like a fine plant, as Allah had honoured him. When he was six years old his mother Amina died
      at Abwa’ between Mecca and Medina on her return from a visit with him to his maternal uncles of Banu 'Adiy bin
      al-Najjar.</p>
    <p>Thus the prophet was left to his grandfather for whom they made a bed in the shade of the Ka'ba. His sons used to
      sit round the bed until he came out to it, but none of them sat upon it out of respect for him. The prophet, still
      a little boy, used to come and sit on it and his uncles would prevent him. When Abdul-Muttalib saw this he said:
      ‘Let my son alone, for by Allah he has a great future.’ Then he would make him sit beside him on his bed and would
      stroke his back with his hand. It used to please him to see what he did.</p>
    <p>When the prophet (SAS) was eight years of age, eight years after the ‘year of the elephant’, his grandfather
      died.</p>
