    <p>Ibn Hisham said :</p>
    <p>"The description of the Prophet (SAS) as mentioned by Umar the mawla of Ghufrah on the authority of Ibrahim ibn
      Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib who said, "When Ali ibn Abi Talib described the Messenger of Allah (SAS), he siad
      "He was of a height not very tall, nor very short, but average among people. His hair was not as over curly nor
      lank, but it was (moderately) curly and combed. He was not corpulent nor did he have a rounded small face. He had
      as white, reddish complexion. His eyes were black. He had long eyelashes and muscular joints, the the part between
      his shoulders was also muscular. The line of hair between his neck and chest was thin and fine. His palms and feet
      were strong. He used to walk firmly and straight, and he used to turn around altogether with his whole body.
      Between his shoulders there was the seal of prophethood and he (SAS) is the seal of all Prophets. He was of all
      mankind the most generous, most courageous, most truthful, most faithful, the best to live with, and the most
      hospitable to accompany. Whoever saw him for the first time venerated him and whoever mixed with him loved him"
    </p>
    <p>The his describer said "I have never seen before him or after him anyone who resembled him, peace be upon him"
