    <p>It is said in popular stories (and only Allah knows the truth) that Amina bint Wahb, the mother of Allah's
      prophet (sas), used to say when she was pregnant with Allah’s prophet that a voice said to her, ‘You are pregnant
      with the lord of this people and when he is born say, “I put him in the care of the One from the evil of every
      envier", then call him Muhammad.’” </p>
    <p>As she was pregnant with him she saw a light come forth from her by which she could see the castles of Busra in
      Syria. Shortly afterwards Abdullah the prophet’s father died while his mother was still pregnant.</p>
