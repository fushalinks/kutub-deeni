  <div class="chapter">
    <p>Khadija had told Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin ‘Abdu’l-'Uzza, who was her (paternal) cousin and a Christian who
      had studied the scriptures and was a knowledgeable. She narrated to him what her slave Maysara had told her that
      the monk had said and how he had seen the two angels shading him.</p>
    <p>Waraqa said, ‘If this is true, Khadija, verily Muhammad is the prophet of this people. I knew that a prophet of
      this people was to be expected. His time has come,‘ or words to that effect. Waraqa was ﬁnding the time of waiting
      wearisome and used to say 'How long ?' Some lines of his on the theme are: </p>

    <i>
      <p>I persevered and was persistent in remembering</p>
      <p>An anxiety which often evoked tears. And</p>
      <p>Conﬁrmatory evidence ltept coming from Khadija.</p>
      <p>Long have I had to wait, O Khadija,</p>
      <p>In the vale of Mecca in spite of my hope</p>
      <p>That I might see the outcome of thy words.</p>
      <p>I could not bear that the words of the monk</p>
      <p>You told me of should prove false:</p>
      <p>That Muhammad should rule over us</p>
      <p>Overcoming those who would oppose him.</p>
      <p>And that a glorious light should appear in the land</p>
      <p>To preserve men from disorders.</p>
      <p>His enemies shall meet disaster</p>
      <p>And his friends shall be victorious.</p>
      <p>Would that I might be there then to see,</p>
      <p>For I should be the ﬁrst of his supporters,</p>
      <p>Ioining in that which Quraysh hate</p>
      <p>However loud they shout in that Mecca of theirs.</p>
      <p>I hope to ascend through him whom they all dislike</p>
      <p>To the Lord of the Throne though they are cast down.</p>
      <p>Is it folly not to disbelievc in Him</p>
      <p>Who chose him Who raised the starry heights?</p>
      <p>If they and I live, things will be done</p>
      <p>Which will throw the unbelievers into confusion.</p>
      <p>And if I die, ’tis but the fate of mortals</p>
      <p>To suffer death and dissolution.</p>
