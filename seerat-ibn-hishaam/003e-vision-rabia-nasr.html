  <h3>The Vision of Rabiah ibn Nasr</h3>
  <h5></h5>
  <div class="chapter">
    <p>Rabi'a ibn Nasr, king of the Yaman, was of the Tubba' kings. He had a vision which terrified him and continued
      to cause him much anxiety. So he summoned every soothsayer, sorcerer, omenmonger and astrologer in his kingdom
      and said: ‘I have had a vision which terrifies me and is a source of anxiety. Tell me what it was and what it
      means.’ </p>
    <p>
      They replied: ‘Tell us the vision and we will tell you its meaning.’</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Rabiah said: ‘If I tell you I can have no confidence in your interpretation; for the only man who knows its
      meaning is he who knows about the vision without my telling him.’ </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon one of them recommended him to send for Shiqq and Satih, for they knew more than others and would be
      able to answer his questions. </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      So he sent for them and Satih arrived first. The king then repeated his words, ending, ‘If you know the vision
      you will know what it means.’ </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Satih replied: </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <i>
      <p>
        A fire you did see </p>
      <p>
        Come forth from the sea. </p>
      <p>
        It fell on the low country </p>
      <p>
        And devoured all that be. </p>
      <p>
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      The king agreed that this was exactly what he had seen, and what was the meaning of it all ? </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered: </p>

    <i>
      <p>
        By the serpent of the lava plains I swear </p>
      <p>
        The Ethiopians on your land shall bear </p>
      <p>
        Ruling from Abyan to Jurash everywhere. </p>
      <p>
    </i>
    <p>
      The king exclaimed that this was distressing news, but when would these things come to pass in his time or after
      him? </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied: [again in rhyme] that more than sixty or seventy years must first pass. </p>
    <p>
      Would the new-comers’ kingdom last?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, an end would be put to it after seventy years or more; then they would be slain or driven out as fugitives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who would do this? </p>
    <p>
      Iram ibn Dhu Yazan, who would come against them from Aden and not leave one of them in the
      Yemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further questions drew the information that their kingdom would not last, but a pure prophet to whom revelation
      came from on high would bring it to an end; he would be a man of the sons of Ghalib ibn Fihr ibn Malik, ibn
      al-Nadr. His dominion would last to the end of time. </p>
    <p>
      Has time an end? asked the king. </p>
    <p>
      Yes, replied Satih, the day on which the first and the last shall be assembled, the righteous for happiness, the
      evildoers for misery. </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you telling me the truth? the king asked. </p>

    <i>
      <p>
        Yes, by the dark and the twilight </p>
      <p>
        And the dawn that follows the night </p>
      <p>
        Verily what I have told you is right. </p>
      <p>
    </i>
    <br>
    <p>
      Later Shiqq arrived and the king acquainted him with the facts but did not tell him what Satih had said, so that
      he might see whether they agreed or differed. His words were: </p>
    <p>
    </p>

    <i>
      <p>
        A fire you did see </p>
      <p>
        Come forth from the sea. </p>
      <p>
        It fell between rock and tree </p>
      <p>
        Devouring all that did breathe. </p>
      <p>
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving that they agreed one with the other and that the difference was a mere choice of words, the king
      asked Shiqq for his interpretation: </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <i>
      <p>
        By the men of the plains I swear </p>
      <p>
        The blacks on your land shall bear </p>
      <p>
        Pluck your little ones from your care </p>
      <p>
        Ruling from Abyan to Najran everywhere. </p>
      <p>
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      The king put the same questions to him and learned that after his time: </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <i>
      <p>
        There shall deliver you from them one mighty, great of name </p>
      <p>
        And put them to the utmost shame. </p>
      <p>
    </i>
    <p>
      He would be: </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <i>
      <p>
        A young man neither remiss nor base </p>
      <p>
        Coming forth from Dhu Yazan’s house, his place, </p>
      <p>
        Not one of them shall leave on Yaman’s face. </p>
      <p>
    </i>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued in answer to the questions already put to his predecessor. </p>
    <p>
      His kingdom shall be ended by an apostle who will bring truth and justice among men of religion and virtue.
      Dominion will rest among his people until the Day of Separation, the day on which those near God will be
      rewarded, on which demands from heaven will be made which the quick and dead will hear, men will be gathered at
      the appointed place, the God-fearing to receive salvation and blessing. By the Lord of heaven and earth, and
      what lies between them high or low I have told you but the truth in which no doubt lies. </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      What these two men said made a deep impression on Rabiah ibn Nasr and he dispatched his sons and family to Iraq
      with all that they might need, giving them a letter to the Persian king Sabur ibn Khurrazadh who let them settle
      in al-Hira. </p>
